# TorchRobotics

This library implements differentiable robot tree from URDF or MCJF robot format, and the differentiable planning objects such as obstacle avoidance, self-collision avoidance and via point.

## Installation

Simply do

```python
pip install -e .
```

## Examples

For benchmarking on computation time of all available robot kinematics

```azure
python examples/forward_kinematics.py
```

For benchmarking on computation time of distance fields

```azure
python examples/collision_distance.py
```

## Acknowledgements

A part of this implementation is inspired from 
the library [differentiable robot model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/differentiable-robot-model).
